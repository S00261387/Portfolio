RogueLike Game (no name yet) is a basic roguelike game, the player spawns in a randomly generated map, enemies have basic AI behavior, some chase you and when at a certain distance, they take position and shoot at you, some others are chasers, they have different appearance (golden) they run much faster than other enemies and deal damage when close enough to melee the player. the player défends himself with a sword and spells (spell costs mana) when all enemies are killed an escape door appears at th center of the map and leads to player to the next level (more difficult, stronger and more enemies). When Killing enemies the player gains xp, when enough xp is earned the player gains levels and 1 upgrade point per level (each level requires more and more xp to access), when the player dies he can select stats he wants to increase like hp, stamina, damage ect (they all cost 1 point to upgrade everytime).There is no end to the game, infinite rounds, infinite number of enemies and infinite upgrade on the player.
